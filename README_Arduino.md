## Arduino configuration
I don't use arduino-ide, it is way to bloaded and slow. I prefer arduino-cli and vim :-).
You can get it from https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/releases. It is only a big executable binary file:
```
user@minipc1:~/Downloads$ tar ztfv arduino-cli_0.29.0_Linux_64bit.tar.gz
-rwxr-xr-x root/root  27425400 2022-11-17 10:22 arduino-cli
-rw-r--r-- runner/docker 35149 2022-11-17 10:21 LICENSE.txt
```
Don't forget to install / upgrade the board ESP32:
```
user@minipc1:~/Arduino$ ./arduino-cli core update-index
Downloading index: package_index.tar.bz2 downloaded
user@minipc1:~/Arduino$ ./arduino-cli core search esp32
ID          Version   Name
esp32:esp32 1.0.5-rc4 ESP32 Arduino
user@minipc1:~/Arduino$ ./arduino-cli core upgrade esp32:esp32
Error during upgrade: Platform '' is already at the latest version
```
Don't forget to install / upgrade the library LibSSH-ESP32:
```
user@minipc1:~/Arduino$ ./arduino-cli lib search libssh
Downloading index: library_index.tar.bz2 downloaded
Name: "LibSSH-ESP32"
  Author: Ewan Parker
  Maintainer: Ewan Parker
  Sentence: SSH client and SSH server library for ESP32 based on libssh.
  Paragraph: This is an ESP32/FreeRTOS port of the libssh.org SSH Library created originally for Linux, Unix or Windows.  Several examples are included, for example an SSH client, SSH server, SCP client, key generator, and over-the-air (OTA) flashing using SCP.

Compiling, flashing monitoring is easy and fast with a little shell script:
```
user@minipc1:~/Arduino$ cat ./do
./arduino-cli compile -b esp32:esp32:esp32 $1 || exit
./arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b esp32:esp32:esp32 $1 || exit
./arduino-cli monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b esp32:esp32:esp32 -c 115200,off,8,none,off,1
```
Example:
```
user@minipc1:~/Arduino$ ./do remotty
